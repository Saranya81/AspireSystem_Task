GIT TASK REPOSITORY
During the Git activity, I engaged in various Git operations and learned fundamental concepts and practices essential for version control and collaborative development
Repository Overview
Repository Link: Saranya81/git_task
Files: The repository contains three files: dummy.txt, index.html, and style.css.
Branches: There are three branches in this repository: main, frontend, and backend.
Git Commands and Activities
1. Adding and Committing Changes
git add <file>: Adds changes in a specified file to the staging area.
git commit -m "<message>": Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
2. Pushing Changes to Remote Repository
git push: Pushes committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository.
3. Pulling Changes from Remote Repository
git pull: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the local branch.
4. Creating and Switching Branches
git checkout -b <branch-name>: Creates a new branch and switches to it.
git branch: Lists all existing branches in the repository.
git checkout <branch-name>: Switches to the specified branch.
5. Resolving Merge Conflicts
During branch merges, Git may encounter conflicts when the same file is modified in different branches. Resolve conflicts by editing the conflicted files and then committing the changes.
What I Learned
Through this Git activity, I've gained hands-on experience in the following areas:

Basic Git Commands: Learned how to add, commit, push, pull, and switch branches using Git commands.
Branching: Explored branching concepts, including creating, switching, and merging branches.
Conflict Resolution: Practiced resolving merge conflicts that occur when integrating changes from different branches.
Version Control Workflow: Understood the importance of version control and how Git facilitates collaborative development.
